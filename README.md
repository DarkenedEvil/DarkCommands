DarkCommands
============

DarkCoammands plugin for the Bukkit API for Minecraft.
DarkCommands was created about a month ago by me(DarkenedEvil) to add some cool things into my minecraft server. I decided to release this to the public because it's my first working plugin and I'm proud of it. It adds things like /hug, /kiss, and /bitchslap!

You can edit and use this code to your liking but Please Please Please give me credit for the original plugin/code. I don't want/need much just a "Original idea by DarkenedEvil" or something like that:D

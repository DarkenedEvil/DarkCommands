DarkCommands
============

DarkCoammands plugin for the Bukkit API for Minecraft.
DarkCommands was created about a month ago by me(DarkenedEvil) to add some cool things into my minecraft server. I decided to release this to the public because it's my first working plugin and I'm proud of it. It adds things like /hug, /kiss, and /bitchslap!
